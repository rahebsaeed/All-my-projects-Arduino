[Weather Meter Kit](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15901) *(SEN-15901)*


Whether you're an agriculturalist, a professional meteorologist, or a weather hobbyist, building a weather station can be a rewarding project. This Arduino library allows users to easily record wind speed, wind direction, and rainfall data from our [weather meter kit](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15901). It should be noted that the sensors in the weather meter kit rely on magnetic reed switches and requires a power source to make any measurements.

- The rain gauge is a self-emptying bucket-type rain gauge, which activates a momentary button closure for each 0.011" of rain that is collected.
- The anemometer (wind speed meter) encodes the wind speed by simply closing a switch which each rotation. A wind speed of 1.492 MPH produces a switch closure once per second.
- The wind vane reports wind direction as a voltage, which is produced by the combination of resistors inside the sensor. The vaneâ€™s magnet could potentially close two switches at once, allowing up to 16 different positions to be indicated, but we have found that 8 positions are more realistic.
