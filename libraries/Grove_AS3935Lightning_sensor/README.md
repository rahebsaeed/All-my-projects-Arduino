# Grove-AS3935-Lightning-sensor



## Getting started
To get starting work with this sensor is very simple, just connect to an Arduino Uno board, or
Seeeduino or other similar boards where you can run the *.ino (Arduino sketches) here placed in
the example folder. To see about connections please look to the pictures collected in the "Images"
folder in this repository. It is suggested to take a look to the documents placed in the Wiki and product
page of Seeedstudio, concerning this sensor. In alternative a project has been placed on "Hackster" in the
"Sensor" section named as AS3935 Lightning sensor, composed by Davide Cogliati.

## Name
Grove-AS3935-Lightning-sensor

## Description
This sensor is extremely sensitive to electromagnetic pulsed waves but has an internal algorithm that permits
to distinguish between noise, disturbances or well shaped lightning pulse (or very close).
All information on this processing is made readable trough the internal registers that can be read trough
I2C bus like well explained in the example folder of this project repository. This sensor is to
be considered as the sensing part of a major hardware that interacts with it in order to get
information and do automated actions with them, as example sending remote alarms on storm approaching,
unsafe airborne operation, protect crops against storm, etc.


## Usage
Example of using this sensor was briefly stated above. More examples can be: handheld devices for trekking,
automated closing or opening shed on storm arrival, safe working on outer iron made structures.

## Roadmap
The roadmap for this sensor is as follows:
1) first definitive layout of sensor rev.1.1 late November 2022.
2) Arduino library first issue preparation with effective examples how to run sensor.
3) Opening a project application with external hardware to automate some early warning actions.
4) Extending automation functions to realize open-close electric circuit or open-close protection
   shed in crop raising.
5) Looking for library expansion based on experiences on field and software writing.

## Contributing
This project is open to hints and contributors interested in effective forecasting of distructive 
storms and develop automated monitoring devices. 
You can help the growing of this project and more sophisticated libraries with a free contribution
that can be $1, $2, $5, $10 or more on your choice, thank you in advance for it. Please send mail if interested to be a contributor.

## Authors and acknowledgment
I would like to thank the Seeedstudio.com for the PCB services and engineering services for
preparation of an effective layout of the sensor and to be part of Codesigner challenge to design
this sensor.

## License
This project is open source free to contribution for finding applications and library enhancement
from everybody is interested to.


## Project status
This project is open and working on deployment of automated systems that alerts on incoming storms
with severe damaging lightnings. Development of libraries to make it easy and ready to use.
